title: How to customize the Camera Manipulation

There are multiple camera manipulation modes built in the engine's [CameraManipulator](../API/SceneTree/Manipulators/SceneTree_Manipulators_CameraManipulator.CameraManipulator).
[**Turntable**](#turntable), [**Tumbler**](#tumbler) and [**Trackball**](#trackball) are distinct modes for orbiting the camera around a model or point of focus.

## Changing the Camera Manipulation Mode

These different modes of camera manipulation are built into Zea Engine, you can change the mode by doing the following:

```javascript
const manipulationMode = CameraManipulator.MANIPULATION_MODES.tumbler
// const manipulationMode = CameraManipulator.MANIPULATION_MODES.turntable
// const manipulationMode = CameraManipulator.MANIPULATION_MODES.trackball

renderer.getViewport().getManipulator().setDefaultManipulationMode(manipulationMode)
```

> If you want to understand more about how these various modes of orbiting differ, please check out [Matt Keeter](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/rotation/)'s explanation.

### Turntable

This mode is mostly recommended when the model has an associated real world axis; but the down side of it is that you can't freely rotate the camera.
Left and right rotate around the global `Z` axis and Up and Down rotate around the local `X` axis.

### Tumbler

This mode lets you freely rotate the camera around the axes, contrary to the [**Turntable**](#turntable) mode, but it causes the model `tumble` when moving the mouse in small circles while moving to the desired position, which end up in undesired rotations.

### Trackball

Projects a `ball` towards onto the model and when the pointer is down, the position in the `ball` is grabbed and used to calculate the rotation, but you can only rotate it a maximum of 180ยบ.
