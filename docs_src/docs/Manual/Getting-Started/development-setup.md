> You'll need to have these recommended applications (or an equivalent) running on your local machine.

### Code Editor

You will need a code editor to create your solution. Zea recommends using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

### Command Shell

Many of the commands in the 'How-To' and Tutorials need to be run in a command shell. For windows users, installing the Git Bash shell provides a powerful tool for running commands.

<!--
## Code Version-Control System
You will need a version-controlled environment for your development. You will also need to run Git Bash to locally host previews of your web development projects.

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## Cloud Hosting

### JavaScript Runtime Environment

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

The most recent versions of Node.js also include [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool whose purpose is to make it easy to run any sort of Node.js based executable that you would normally install via a package manager.

### JavaScript Package Manager

Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.
