All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/compare/v3.12.3...v4.0.0) (2021-11-10)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* Canvas must now be nested under a another DOM element that it is resized to fit 100%
This addresses a circular relationship where the canvas width and height must be calculated
based on its parent, not on itself.

```css
#rendererHolder {
  width: 500;
  height: 300;
}
#renderer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

```html
<div id="canvasHolder">
  <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
</div>
```

* The Scene Tree now contains only TreeItems. This means items such as Kinematic Solvers can no longer be added as children in the tree.

* Scene Settings has been removed, and its values migrated to either the Scene or the Viewport.


Old code
```javascript
const color = new Color('#E5E5E5')
scene.getSettings().getParameter('BackgroundColor').setValue(color)
```

New code
```javascript
const color = new Color('#E5E5E5')
renderer.getViewport().backgroundColorParam.value = color
```

* VertexAttributes are now typed. Adding Vertex Attributes to geometries now requires that the user constructs the appropriate typed attribute, then adds it to the geometry.

Old code
```javascript
const attr = geom.addVertexAttribute('foo', Vec3)
```

New code
```javascript
const attr = new Vec3Attribute()
points.addVertexAttribute('foo', attr)
```

* VertexAttribute values are no longer initialized to zero and must be explicitly initialized.

New code
```javascript
const line = new Lines()
line.setNumVertices(2)
line.setNumSegments(1)
line.setSegmentVertexIndices(0, 0, 1)
line.getVertexAttribute('positions').setValue(0, new Vec3(0, 0, 0))
line.getVertexAttribute('positions').setValue(1, new Vec3(0, 0, 1))
```



* VertexAttributes.length was removed and replaced with getCount

Old code
```javascript
const attr = geom.addVertexAttribute('foo', Vec3)
attr.length
```

New code
```javascript
const attr = new Vec3Attribute()
attr.getCount()
```

* Assets are now loaded using the 'load' method instead of using the 'FilePath' parameters.

Old code
```javascript
const objAsset = new ObjAsset('cow')
objAsset.getParameter('FilePath').setValue('data/cow.obj')
objAsset.on('loaded').then(() => {
  renderer.frameAll()
})
```

New code
```javascript
const objAsset = new ObjAsset('cow')
objAsset.load('data/cow.obj').then(() => {
  renderer.frameAll()
})
```

* EnvMap are now loaded using the 'load' method instead of using the 'FilePath' parameters.

Old code
```javascript
const envMap = new EnvMap()
envMap.getParameter('FilePath').setValue('data/pisa-webp.zenv')
envMap.on('loaded').then(() => {
  ...
})
```

New code
```javascript
const envMap = new EnvMap('cow')
envMap.load('data/pisa-webp.zenv').then(() => {
  ...
})
```


* EnvMap are now loaded using the 'load' method instead of using the 'FilePath' parameters.

Old code
```javascript
const image = new FileImage('albedo')
image.getParameter('FilePath').setValue('data/steelplate1-unity/steelplate1_albedo.webp')
image.on('loaded').then(() => {
  ...
})
```

New code
```javascript
const image = new FileImage('albedo')
image.load('data/steelplate1-unity/steelplate1_albedo.webp').then(() => {
  ...
})
```

* getSelectable was renamed to isSelectable 

Old code
```javascript
const geomItem = new GeomItem('foo')
geomItem.getSelectable()
```

New code
```javascript
const geomItem = new GeomItem('foo')
geomItem.isSelectable()
```

* GLShader.getParamDeclarations was replaced with getMaterialTemplate 
getParamDeclarations would return an array of parameter descriptors, but now we return an instance of a Material from getMaterialTemplate instead.

Old code
```javascript
  static getParamDeclarations() {
    const paramDescs = super.getParamDeclarations()
    paramDescs.push({
      name: 'BaseColor',
      defaultValue: new Color(1.0, 1.0, 0.5),
    })
    return paramDescs
  }
```

New code
```javascript
  static getMaterialTemplate(): Material {
    const material = new Material()
    return material
  }
```

* The deprecated Group class was removed from the build. You must now use one of the specialized classes based on BaseGroup. e.g. SelectionSet, or KinematicGroup.

### Features

* auto-position the canvas and its parent ([18b8a90](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/18b8a90d4b9da50e232dccc5d10cb1f8e773d5db))
* The engine now provides various statically defined Materials. This simplifies the process of assigning materials to Geometries, as the parameters are exposed as public properties. ([ae92d20](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/ae92d20fae158c4f4fbb746227bc4ce8f04ef494))
* zcad files when loading now construct statically defined materials when possible. ([4acad4e](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/4acad4e7aafd938aab58fa310a4e45be166f2cbd))

* Vec2, Vec3, Vec4, Quat, Color, Xfo, Mat3 and Mat4 parameters can now be encoded in zcad files. ([1b17f76](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/1b17f76c9cf390433d84232cbaaa1dc4c7235729))
* Parameters are now accessible directly on the class as public members.
* Parameter values are now accessible as a property via getter and setter.

```javascript
geomItem.getParameter('LocalXfo').setValue(xfo)
```

The new, more convenient access looks like the following.
```javascript
geomItem.localXfoParam.value = xfo
```

### Bug Fixes

* Cutaways are now applied to GeomData and Highlight rendering so surfaces that are both highlighted and cutaway, the highlight is also cutaway.
* The GEOMITEM_INVISIBLE_IN_GEOMDATA is now being honored in the SimpleSurfaceShader and FlatSurfaceShader.

## [3.11.1](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/compare/v3.11.0...v3.11.1) (2021-09-22)

### Bug Fixes

* InstanceItem no longer clones the children of the source tree item. This means that CADPart or CADAssembly should always be found under an InstanceItem, where before you might find a CADBody or a GeomItem. 
* To keep compatibility with version < 3.11.0, the plugins.umd.js script has been re-added to the build with a deprecation warning. This allows code to load the plugins file and generate a warning instead of an error.


## [3.11.0](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/compare/v3.10.6...v3.11.0) (2021-09-15)

### Notes:

For this release, the 'plugins' file is no longer being built and should be removed from your script tags.
The plugins are now bundled into the engine library and so the plugins tag should be simply removed 

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@zeainc/zea-engine@3/dist/plugins.umd.js"></script>
```

### Features

* ZeaEngine now supports bundlers such as webpack or rollup. ([7696c09](https://github.com/ZeaInc/zea-engine/commit/7696c09b8ccbe4664db9b0342fce83d15531bedc))

* camera panning in orthographic mode now correctly tracks the mouse pointer.
    
* CameraManipulator now maintains screen space geometry position under the mouse while mouse wheel zooming of orthographic cameras.

* Camera framing now uses GeomItem bounding box if the geometry has not yet been loaded.
    
* The frustum culling system now correctly culls items for orthographic cameras.
    
* Surface lighting in orthographic rendering is now consistent for geometry anywhere on screen. Shaders now use the camera zaxis as the view vector.

* Outline shader now adapts sensitivity on a per-pixel basis. This reduces moirÃ© patterns seen on some background surfaces as the camera zoomed into a foreground object.

* Camera near and far planes are adjusted on view framing to fit the scene size. The auto near/far plane multipliers are now much more tightly fitting the scenes, which reduces moirÃ© patterns seen on background surfaces.
    
* Camera framing would sometimes cause a corrupt camera matrix when framing on a CADAsset before the geometries were loaded.

* Silhouettes now have smoother graduations in darkness.
